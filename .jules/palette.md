## 2024-05-22 - DX is UX for Libraries
**Learning:** For a utility library, "UX" often means Developer Experience (DX). Clear, rich JSDoc comments with `@example` and `@see` links make the library much easier to adopt and debug without leaving the IDE.
**Action:** Always check if public exports have sufficient documentation, including usage examples and external references where applicable.
